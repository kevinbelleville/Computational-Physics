Project 1 is about the harmonic oscillator and differential equation solvers. We examine the different methods such as Euler's method, Sympletic Euler and Runge-Kutte, and notice their strengths and weaknesses.

Project 2 is about the anharmoic quantum oscillator. We are essentially solving the quantum harmonic oscillator and then changing it slightly with an extra factor and examining how this factor affects the energy levels of the system. In this project, we had to understand how to use numpy modules to perform linear algebra. We also learned to memoize functions such that we can maximize our efficiency, as we had to use factorials to calculate the Hermite polynomials.

Project 3 uses Markov Chains to simulate a Monte-Carlo system. Here we are modelling the Ising model in 2D, which is basically a grid of particles that can interact with their neighbors. We run this system over many iterations to see what happens to the system over time, depending on the input values. We use our temperature value as the "randomness" factor or how often the Monte-Carlo system can randomly change.

Project 4 is about using Fourier transforms to analyze a signal spectrum, in this case, the relationship between the Sun's sunspots and the cosmic rays coming from outer space. We learned how to use Correlation functions and how to cutoff the signal at different frequencies to examine the spectrum in parts.
